# Cadocary facts

As of October 25, 2026.

The facts about Cadocary LLC that the agents may use. Nothing about Cadocary may be claimed unless it is here or in `private.md` beside it. Our code writes both files into the memory store, and the agents only read them.

Facts change. To update one, edit this file (or `private.md`), change the date above, and rerun `agent/setup.py`. New sessions get the new facts; running sessions keep the ones they started with.

Sources:

- **Site:** cadocary.com, read October 25, 2026. The source is the exact page URL.
- **Capability statement:** Doug's one-page PDF, "Cadocary LLC.pdf", cited by page. It is not in the repo because it holds personal contact details.
- **Registration:** the team's sourcing profile, from Cadocary's SAM.gov registration.
- **Doug:** what he told the team.

Each fact has:

- an id, which the qualifier and drafter cite
- the fact. Words in quotation marks are copied exactly from the source.
- its source
- whether Doug has approved it

`private.md` holds what must stay out of the public repo: prices, the street address, and the personal and client contact details. Agents get it in the same memory store when it exists.

Until a fact is approved, the agents may use it for qualifying and research, but the drafter lists it for Doug's confirmation before relying on it. No fact is approved yet.

No single set of facts fits every RFP. Which past work, references, staff, and claims to use is chosen per bid, following the company-facts skill.

## Client work

SpendLogic, Hotels4Truckers, and PURLPal are not Cadocary products. They are the clients' products, which Cadocary designed and built under contract.

| id | fact | source | approved |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| work.overview | "A selection of the contract software Cadocary has designed and built for enterprise clients — end-to-end engagements delivered as a design and implementation partner, from first spec to a shipped, working product." | https://cadocary.com/work/ | no |

Each case study says: "Cadocary served as the software design and implementation consultancy for this engagement". Results on these pages are reported by the client, and the pages say so. The capability statement lists all three as past performance, with Cadocary as prime contractor.

Neither source gives dates, contract values, or team size for any of them. The capability statement names a contact at each client; those are in `private.md`, and none has agreed to be a reference.

### SpendLogic

| id | fact | source | approved |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| work.spendlogic.client | Client: SpendLogic (spendlogic.com). Cadocary was the software design and implementation consultancy. | https://cadocary.com/work/spendlogic/ | no |
| work.spendlogic.past_performance | SpendLogic.com, with Cadocary as "Prime Contractor". Scope: "Developed a procurement compliance documentation templating engine that streamlines the creation of standardized procurement documents, improving consistency, accuracy, and workflow efficiency." | Capability statement, page 1 | no |
| work.spendlogic.scope | "Cadocary designed and implemented an end-to-end procurement-compliance documentation templating engine for SpendLogic, guiding federal contractors through the CPSR documentation that keeps their purchasing systems audit-ready." | https://cadocary.com/work/spendlogic/ | no |
| work.spendlogic.problem | "Federal contractors and agencies live under the Contractor Purchasing System Review (CPSR) — a high-stakes audit of how they document and justify their purchasing decisions." | https://cadocary.com/work/spendlogic/ | no |
| work.spendlogic.approach | "Cadocary started inside the compliance workflow rather than the code." From that model it designed a guided templating engine: "buyers answer structured prompts and the system produces standardized, policy-aligned documentation every time." | https://cadocary.com/work/spendlogic/ | no |
| work.spendlogic.built | What was built: "SpendFile documentation folders that assemble a complete, consistent purchase record"; "Guided price analysis generation with standardized, reviewer-ready formatting"; "Structured source justifications that stay aligned with purchasing policy"; "Integration with clients' existing ERP systems, plus a FedRAMP version for government agencies". | https://cadocary.com/work/spendlogic/ | no |
| work.spendlogic.results | "SpendLogic reports that its customers achieve a 20:1 ROI and a 100% CPSR pass rate since 2016". The page marks these "Results reported by SpendLogic." | https://cadocary.com/work/spendlogic/ | no |
| work.spendlogic.govcon | Among what "SpendLogic reports": "50 years of GovCon experience". The page does not say this experience is Cadocary's. | https://cadocary.com/work/spendlogic/ | no |

### Hotels4Truckers

| id | fact | source | approved |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| work.hotels4truckers.client | Client: Hotels4Truckers (hotels4truckers.com). Cadocary was the software design and implementation consultancy. | https://cadocary.com/work/hotels4truckers/ | no |
| work.hotels4truckers.past_performance | Hotels4Truckers.com, with Cadocary as "Prime Contractor". Scope: "Developed a web and mobile booking platform that enables truck drivers to search for and book hotels with truck-friendly parking, delivering a streamlined reservation experience across web and mobile devices." | Capability statement, page 1 | no |
| work.hotels4truckers.scope | "Cadocary designed and implemented an end-to-end booking platform for Hotels4Truckers across web and native iOS and Android apps, helping truckers find and book hotels with real tractor-trailer parking at member rates." | https://cadocary.com/work/hotels4truckers/ | no |
| work.hotels4truckers.problem | "A tractor-trailer needs up to 75 feet of parking." General hotel booking sites gave drivers "no reliable way to filter for hotels that could actually accommodate them." | https://cadocary.com/work/hotels4truckers/ | no |
| work.hotels4truckers.approach | "Cadocary treated the core asset as data: a trucker-friendly hotel database built from scratch, capturing which properties can genuinely handle large-vehicle parking rather than trusting generic listings." Around it, "one experience delivered on the web and on native mobile". | https://cadocary.com/work/hotels4truckers/ | no |
| work.hotels4truckers.built | What was built: "A purpose-built database of trucker-friendly hotels with tractor-trailer parking (up to 75 ft)"; "Rate comparison and booking flows tuned for on-the-road use"; "Free membership unlocking 10–15% discounts at partner chains"; "Native iOS and Android apps sharing the web platform's booking experience". | https://cadocary.com/work/hotels4truckers/ | no |

### PURLPal

| work.purlpal.client | Client: PURLPal (purlpal.ai). Cadocary was the software design and implementation consultancy. | https://cadocary.com/work/purlpal/ | no |
| work.purlpal.past_performance | PurlPal.ai, with Cadocary as "Prime Contractor". Scope: "Developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot for Medicare Advantage plans, incorporating web scraping capabilities to aggregate, process, and deliver accurate, context-aware information through an AI-powered conversational interface." | Capability statement, page 1 | no |
| work.purlpal.scope | "Cadocary designed and implemented an end-to-end RAG-enabled chatbot for PURLPal that answers questions over Medicare Advantage plan data, kept current by a webscraping pipeline that ingests plan details as they change." | https://cadocary.com/work/purlpal/ | no |
| work.purlpal.problem | Medicare Advantage has "thousands of plans", changing yearly. "A general chatbot can't be trusted here — it either doesn't know the specifics or invents them." | https://cadocary.com/work/purlpal/ | no |
| work.purlpal.approach | "rather than letting a model answer from memory, the assistant retrieves the relevant Medicare Advantage plan data first and generates its answer strictly from that grounded context." It is paired with "a webscraping and ingestion pipeline that continuously gathers plan information and keeps the knowledge base fresh." | https://cadocary.com/work/purlpal/ | no |
| work.purlpal.built | What was built: "A webscraping pipeline that collects and normalizes Medicare Advantage plan data"; "An ingestion and indexing layer that turns that data into a retrievable knowledge base"; "A RAG-enabled chatbot that retrieves relevant plan details and answers questions grounded in them"; "A refresh cycle that keeps answers aligned with current plan information". | https://cadocary.com/work/purlpal/ | no |
| work.purlpal.outcome | "PURLPal launched as a working assistant that answers Medicare Advantage questions in plain language, grounded in retrieved plan data rather than guesswork." The page gives no numbers. | https://cadocary.com/work/purlpal/ | no |

## Who the work is for

| id | fact | source | approved |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| audience.public_defenders | DocketBot: "Back office tools for WA State Misdemeanor Public Defense Attorneys." | https://cadocary.com/ | no |
| audience.private_defenders | "ClientCheck for private defenders" | https://cadocary.com/ | no |
| audience.federal_contractors | "SpendLogic for federal contractors" | https://cadocary.com/ | no |
| audience.enterprise_clients | "Our portfolio of software delivered on contract engagements with enterprise clients" | https://cadocary.com/ | no |

## Team

The website names no people. The capability statement names only the point of contact (in `private.md`). Neither gives staff, roles, resumes, or headcount, so treat staff as unknown.

## Doug's preferences

| id | fact | source | approved |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| prefs.value_range | Contracts priced between $1 million and $5 million: nothing under $1 million, and $5 million is a hard limit. This replaces the earlier "$25,000 and up". | Doug, Oct 25 | no |
| prefs.no_military | No military applications. | Doug, Oct 25 | no |
| prefs.work_type | Software and IT work. Custom software contracts suit Cadocary best. | Doug, Oct 25 | no |
| prefs.offshore_staff | Cadocary uses offshore developers, so contracts that allow them are better. A clause requiring US persons only or barring offshore access counts against a bid, and stops it if Cadocary plainly cannot meet it. | Doug, Oct 25 | no |
| prefs.location | Washington buyers preferred. Federal buyers are allowed, since the pipeline searches SAM.gov. | Doug, Oct 25 | no |
| prefs.response_time | At least 7 days to respond. | Doug, Oct 25 | no |
| prefs.facts_per_bid | No standard set of facts fits every RFP. Which past projects, references, staff, and claims to use depends on the bid. | Doug, Oct 25 | no |

## Not known yet

Treat each of these as unknown. Never guess any of them.

- insurance: types, limits, carriers, and expiry dates
- certifications, including small business, OMWBE, SOC 2, and FedRAMP. The FedRAMP version in `work.spendlogic.built` is SpendLogic's product, not a Cadocary authorization.
- CJIS readiness, background checks, and where hosted work would run
- set-aside eligibility
- past government contracts, their buyers, dates, and values
- dates, values, and permission to name the client for the SpendLogic, Hotels4Truckers, and PURLPal work. The client contacts in `private.md` are not references until they agree.
- how many offices or attorneys use DocketBot and ClientCheck, and which ones may be named
- references and their permission to be named
- staff, roles, and resumes, and who may sign bids
- years in business
- prices and rates. The only prices on the site are the $30/month DocketBot and ClientCheck licenses, which are not a bid price list.
- registrations other than SAM.gov, such as WEBS, Public Purchase, and the Washington business license
