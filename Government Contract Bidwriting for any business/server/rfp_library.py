"""The RFP Library and each RFP's findings, read only, for the app's sidebar, Today, and RFP pages.

agent/library.py writes the library; this only reads it. The app polls, so answers are cached for
a little while, and a memory is read again only when its content has changed.

The app has no login, so an answer carries only the fields its pages show, and contact details
are scrubbed out: drafts are built from Doug's private facts, and any finding can quote them. The
draft itself goes out only through proposal(), stripped the same way and without the agent's
notes to Doug. notes.md never goes out.
