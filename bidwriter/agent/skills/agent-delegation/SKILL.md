# Agent delegation

Version 0. The order and rules below come from the team's plan and three plan reviews. They will be refined from the study of real RFPs.

## The run

The flow for every RFP: the Reader reads it, the Qualifier decides, and only a `pursue` goes on to research and drafting. Each agent hands its result back to you, and you send the next step.

1. **Get the RFPs.** If the starting message names RFPs or attaches their files, use those. Otherwise run intake (below), and take every `pursue` and `consider` notice from it.
2. **Read every RFP, then qualify every RFP.** Both steps are cheap.
   1. **Read.** Send the Reader the folder of attached documents, `/mnt/session/uploads/<rfp-id>/`, and name the output path `/mnt/session/outputs/<rfp-id>/sheet.json`. The Reader also writes `summary.md` next to it. Our code attaches every document before the run starts, so this is the normal case. Send attachment links instead only for documents that aren't attached: ones the starting message lists as not attached, or RFPs you found through intake in this run.
   2. **Qualify.** Send the Qualifier the summary and sheet paths and the output path `qualification.json`. If `decision` is `pass`, write the packet with `recommendation: pass` and the reasons, and that RFP is done.
3. **Work the pursued RFPs, one at a time, nearest deadline first.** Do at most 3 in a run unless the message says otherwise, and list the rest in your final reply. For each one:
   1. **Research.** Send the Researcher the sheet and qualification paths and the output path `research.json`.
   2. **Check the research.** Ask the Qualifier to check `research.json` and write `check-research-<round>.json`. On `revise`, send the issue list, word for word, back to the Researcher. Allow at most two rounds. If it still fails, or the check says `block`, write a pass packet that says "no-go, could not verify" with the issues, and move on.
   3. **Check the value.** Doug wants contracts priced between $1 million and $5 million. Read `value_estimate` in the checked `research.json`. If `likely` is under $1,000,000 or over $5,000,000 and `confidence` is `medium` or `high`, don't draft. Write a pass packet instead, with `expected_worth` from the research and a headline such as "Pass: likely worth $600,000 (medium confidence), under Doug's $1 million to $5 million range." With `low` confidence, go on to draft, and add a `calls_for_doug` entry giving the estimate and the range.
   4. **Draft.** Send the Drafter the sheet, qualification, research, and facts paths and the output folder.
   5. **Check the draft.** Ask the Qualifier to check `draft.json` and the proposal files and write `check-draft-<round>.json`. Allow at most two rounds with the Drafter, the same way.
   6. **Packet.** Write `packet.json` (below), then `review.md` from `templates/review.md` (see "Doug's review").
4. **Finish** with one line per RFP: the buyer, the title, send or pass, and the expected worth.

If the message asks for only some steps, such as "read and qualify only", stop where it says.

## Intake: pulling new RFPs

The `sam-research` tools search SAM.gov live and remember nothing between calls. The RFP library is how we know what has already been seen.

1. **Search.**
   - Call `search_opportunities` with Cadocary's NAICS and PSC codes from `/mnt/memory/cadocary-facts/README.md`.
   - Set `days` to 60, unless the message gives another window. Leave out `set_aside_eligibility` until the facts list Cadocary's set-asides.
   - Results come 40 to a page, nearest deadline first. Call again with `offset` set to `next_offset` until `has_more` is false.
   - Search once per run. Save each page to a working file as it arrives, and work from that file instead of searching again.
2. **Drop what we have worked.** Our code stores every open notice in the library with status `new`. Skip any notice that `/mnt/memory/rfp-library/index.md` (or the month files it lists) shows with any other status.
3. **First look.** Judge each new notice from its title and description. Mark it `pursue`, `consider`, or `skip`, with one line on why.
   - Skip purchases of hardware, parts, or brand-name licenses with no services.
   - Skip notices of intent to sole-source to a named vendor.
   - Skip military or defense work: any Department of Defense, armed service, or defense agency buyer, or a system for military use. Doug takes no military applications.
   - Skip notices that state a total value under $1 million or over $5 million. When the value isn't stated, judge on the rest.
   - Skip work far from Cadocary's products and capabilities.
   - For `market research` notices (RFIs and sources sought), mark them `consider` only when the work is squarely in scope.
   - When a description is too thin to judge, use `consider`.
4. **Open the promising ones.** Call `get_notice` only for `pursue` and `consider` notices.
5. **Write `/mnt/session/outputs/intake.json`.**

```json
{
  "searched": {"naics": [], "psc": [], "days": 60, "total": 0, "pages": 0, "dropped": {}},
  "already_seen": 0,
  "notices": [
    {"notice_id": "", "title": "", "agency": "", "response_kind": "bid | pre-bid | market research",
     "response_deadline": "", "days_left": 0, "url": "",
     "first_look": "pursue | consider | skip", "reason": "",
     "attachments": [{"name": "", "url": "", "size_bytes": 0}]}
  ]
}
```

List every new notice, including the skips, so their reasons are kept. `attachments` is filled only for notices you opened.

## What to hand an agent

The other agents do not see your conversation. Every message to them stands on its own:

- the RFP id, buyer, and title
- the paths to read. Never paste or summarize the files' contents; they read the originals.
- the exact output path, and which section of their skill gives the format
- for a revision: the numbered issue list, word for word
- for a check: what is being checked, and the round number

Example:

```
RFP wa-example-001, City of Example, "Case management software".
Read: /mnt/session/outputs/wa-example-001/sheet.json and /mnt/memory/cadocary-facts/.
Qualify it and write /mnt/session/outputs/wa-example-001/qualification.json
in the format under "Output" in your skill.
```

## Wait for the reply

After you hand work to a helper, stop and wait for its reply message. Reading a long RFP takes minutes.

- **A missing file before the reply arrives is not a failure.** Don't check for the file until the helper says it is done.
- **Report only what a helper actually said,** in its own words. Never describe a reply you haven't received, and never fill in its details.
- **If no reply comes** after the helper's thread goes idle, ask it once what happened, and act on its answer.

## Before moving to the next step

Open the output file and confirm:

- it exists and is valid JSON
- every field in the skill's format is present
- every number has a citation or is listed under `educated_guesses`

If any check fails, send it back once, naming the problem exactly. A step that fails twice ends that RFP with a pass packet that explains why.

## When nobody is there to ask

Doug is not available during a run. Never stop to ask him something.

- **Fatal problem** (deadline too close, mandatory meeting missed, a required license Cadocary lacks, military work, a value outside $1 million to $5 million): write a pass packet with the quote and page, and move on.
- **Uncertain call:** take the safer option, say why, and list it under `calls_for_doug`.
- **Missing fact or data:** report it as missing. Never fill it in.

## The packet: `/mnt/session/outputs/<rfp-id>/packet.json`

This is the one screen Doug reads.

```json
{
  "rfp_id": "",
  "headline": "You are a competitive applicant for <title>. Expected worth $<likely> (<confidence> confidence). Permission to send?",
  "recommendation": "send | pass",
  "expected_worth": {"low": 0, "likely": 0, "high": 0, "confidence": "high | medium | low", "basis": ""},
  "why_competitive": [{"reason": "", "source": ""}],
  "risks": [{"risk": "", "source": ""}],
  "deadlines": [{"kind": "", "as_written": "", "page": 0}],
  "sheet": "",
  "calls_for_doug": [{"topic": "", "choice_made": "", "why": ""}],
  "open_items": [""],
  "checks": {"research": "pass | revise | block", "draft": "pass | revise | block"},
  "files": {"proposal": "", "qualification": "", "research": ""}
}
```

For a pass, set `recommendation` to `pass`, start the headline with "Pass:" and the reason, and leave out the draft fields.

## Doug's review: `/mnt/session/outputs/<rfp-id>/review.md`

`packet.json` is for the app. `review.md` is what Doug actually reads, in one sitting, before he chooses Send, Fix this, or Pass. Copy `templates/review.md` in this skill and fill it in:

- **Copy, don't compose.** Every value comes from `packet.json`, `sheet.json`, `qualification.json`, `research.json`, or `draft.json`, with its source kept. You add no new claims, numbers, or judgments.
- **Binding commitments come first.** Fill "What you would be committing to" from `draft.json` `commitments`. Doug reads what binds Cadocary before anything else.
- **Every open item is a checkbox** under "Before you can send": signatures, forms, and every `[MISSING: ...]` in the proposal.
- **Dates as written.** Copy deadlines exactly from `sheet.json`, with any time zone note.
- **Reading time:** about 250 words a minute over the review plus the proposal.
- **A pass** uses the short "Pass version" at the end of the template.

When done, `review.md` has no `{{`, `}}`, or `<!--` left.

## Limits

- No more than two revision rounds for any step.
- A session holds at most 25 helper threads, so finish one RFP before starting the next.
- You cannot send, submit, upload, or email anything, and you never ask another agent to.
